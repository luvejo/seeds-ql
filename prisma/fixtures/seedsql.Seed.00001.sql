Most people plant on poles or fencing but i prefer sunflowers, giving two crops from the same space. Especially prone to Mexican bean beetles. Those which mature too late for drying i shell and freeze; serve mixed with chopped sweet corn and chopped sweet pepper. Given to me by my late friend and UNH plant breeder Elwyn Meader.</p>",1),

GD is an old English ind. cherry tomato, round, very productive, wonderful juicy flavour, but very prone to cracking. RC is a det. paste type, somewhat late maturing, dry flesh, res. to cracking. GS is ind. somewhat late, but very productive of long trellises of heart-shaped crack-res. fruit, exquisite sweet flavour; skin is tougher than GD, but solider flesh with even better richer flavour. This is catching on very rapidly in the seed trade.</p>",1),

They seem to exhibit greater extremes of variation and of course they\'re much heavier yielding, if somewhat later.</p>  <p>For many gardeners the obstacle is getting poles; well, I have 85 acres of poles but I don\'t grow most of my pole beans on poles – not the dry beans anyway – but rather on my sunflowers and amaranth, which gives me a double yield on the same land. Many of my favourite cooking/eating varieties, like Jacob\'s Cattle and pintos, are bush types, or so I thought. Then I discovered Roark, a pole form of the common pinto.</p>  <p>I got my seeds from a friend, Steve Bellavia, who was having trouble maintaining his large bean collection and was happy to unload some of it on me. I was happy to get it, and this serendipitous find has become one of the principle beans in my diet (a vegan diet in which dry beans play an important role). I intend to keep it going and further share it with others.</p>",2);
